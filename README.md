# Waitless
This application was written to try and come up with a site where users could log on and check the current wait times of restaurants. It's a pretty rough prototype at the moment, but users can post wait times of restaurants and these wait times can be voted on. There's also a Google Maps view of the restaurant's location that you're currently looking at. 

I've pushed the repo to Github to see if any further development comes from it.

The site is currently hosted on Heroku and can be visited at [austin-waitless.heroku.com](austin-waitless.heroku.com). I've gotten a decent amount configured on the Heroku end, but I'm open for suggestions on how to make the site better since this is my first attempt at making a live site.
